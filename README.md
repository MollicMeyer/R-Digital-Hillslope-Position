### Automated digital hillslope position classification algorithm - Miller and Schaetzl (2015)

Classification of hillslope position has a long history in soil geomorphology. However, its roots in tacit field knowledge has prevented its use in GIS. The model provided here has been calibrated and validated on soil scientists’ observations in the field. The resulting maps of hillslope position represent base maps that can be used to (1) improve research on toposequences by providing explicit definitions of each hillslope element’s location, (2) facilitate the disaggregation of soils currently mapped as complexes, and (3) identify map unit inclusions that exist due to subtle topographic variation. The base maps developed by the model can also help identify areas of possible mismapping, especially where soil boundaries cross topographic breaks. This information can enable the mapper to redefine many existing soil map unit boundaries, placing them more correctly at locations where defendable landscape breaks exist.
